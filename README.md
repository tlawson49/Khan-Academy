# Khan Academy

### What is the history of Khan Academy?

Khan Academy is a not-for-profit educational organization started by Salman Khan in 2008. Our mission is to provide a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere.

Our online materials cover subjects ranging from math and finance to history and art. With thousands of bite-sized videos, step-by-step problems, and instant progress 
information, Khan Academy provides a rich and engaging learning experience. You can earn points and badges along the way, and coach others as well.

In addition to creating our online materials, we also translate our materials into the world's most spoken languages and work with schools on innovating how learning 
is done in the classroom.  Read more about Khan Academy's goals at http://www.khanacademy.org/about. 

### Who started Khan Academy?

Khan Academy was founded by Salman Khan. Sal was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. His mother was born in Calcutta, India; and his father was born in Barisal, 
Bangladesh. Sal is a former hedge fund analyst with degrees from MIT and Harvard. 

### How was Khan Academy started?

In August 2004, Sal Khan began remotely tutoring his cousin, Nadia, who was struggling with unit conversion. This "Swiss-cheese" gap in her knowledge was not allowing 
her to be placed in the more advanced math track. Since Nadia was in New Orleans, and Sal was in Boston working at a hedge fund at the time, Sal started tutoring her 
through the phone and Yahoo Doodle after work.

As Nadia improved in math class, word got around and Sal started tutoring a handful of his cousins and family members. Scheduling became a real issue, and he decided 
to begin recording videos and posting them on YouTube in 2006 so everyone could watch at their own pace. More and more people started watching, and Sal has been 
making videos ever since.

The organization was incorporated as a 501c(3) nonprofit in 2008. Sal continued to work on Khan Academy during his spare time until the fall of 2009, when he quit his 
hedge fund job and decided to pursue the endeavor full-time. He lived off of his savings for the first nine months, until he received his first significant donation 
from Ann Doerr. In September 2010, Khan Academy received large grants from Google ($2 million) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ($1.5 million) and began to 
build out an organization. 

Sal called on Shantanu Sinha from McKinsey & Company to join as President & COO. They were former high school math competitors in New Orleans, freshman year roommates 
at MIT, and long-time friends. They immediately hired Ben Kamens and Jason Rosoff from Fog Creek Software to lead software development and design. In October 2010, the 
small team moved into their first office space. 

### What are Khan Academy's Community Guidelines?

The mission of Khan Academy is to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere, and the goal of these Community Guidelines is to provide a welcoming 
environment where everyone feels comfortable learning.  

#### Give a great answer

- We're teaching each other – so, instead of responding with "Yes" or "No", share your answer the way your favorite teacher would! Give complete answers that are 
easy to understand.

- Remember that you were once new here, too! Be patient and take the time to make people feel welcome and help them get started on their learning journey. Share your 
own tips and tricks for using Khan Academy.

- When relevant, it can be helpful share links to additional resources that people might find useful (such as articles in our Help Center).

#### Be self-sufficient

- Before asking a question, do a quick check to see if it’s been asked before. If it has, add your comment in the existing thread, or vote someone else’s comment 
up. You can also find great resources in our Help Center and Support Community.

- If someone has already answered a question, don't repeat their answer – upvote it instead.

Here's what to avoid:

- Low-quality comments

  - These include duplicate answers, nonsense, spam or repetitive posts, advertisements, low-quality links, asking others to follow you or upvote your posts, and 
  anything containing offensive language.

  - Anything rude or disrespectful to another Khan Academy member, including volunteers and staff. This includes impersonating someone else.

  - In general, if you’re not comfortable with a parent or teacher reading what you’re writing, it’s best not to post it.  Remember that Khan Academy is used by 
  learners of all ages, and we expect everyone’s comments to reflect that.

- Off-topic discussions

  - Keep the conversations relevant to the subject that you’re posting in. Questions and comments not related to khanacademy.org subject content should be posted in 
  the appropriate subforum in the Support Community.  This includes Computer Programming projects - comments and discussions should stay focused on the code itself.

  - Since Khan Academy is focused on learning above all else, we ask that discussion about religion and current political events generally be kept off the site.  There 
  are many places on the internet where these discussions are very welcome, but we’ve found these topics to be largely distracting on Khan Academy.  
  
    - Note: exceptions can be made for certain pieces of humanities content (such as history), but please take a minute before posting to make sure that any comments 
    you make are truly in the best interest of the community.

  - Don’t solicit personal information from others (this includes real names, email addresses, ages, locations, and anything else that someone might want to keep 
  private), or post personal information that isn’t appropriate to share publicly.
  
Violations of these Guidelines may result in post removal, suspension of commenting privileges, and other administrative actions.

### Why was I banned?

In general, users who persistently violate Khan Academy's Community Guidelines may be banned from community activities by a Guardian. If you'd like specific 
information about why your account was banned, or if you'd like to submit a ban appeal, please fill out and submit a Ban Appeal Form.

A Guardian will review your request and respond to you via a Guardian message on your profile. Please note that we receive lots of ban appeal requests, so it may 
take several days to receive a response.

### What are the guidelines for posting links, images, and videos on the community forums?

These are guidelines for posting links, images, and videos in our discussion forums and Support Community. For guidelines on user-created programs, consult the 
Guidelines tab under the program.

#### Links

- For the use of links on user-generated JS programs, see the JS Guidelines. These can be found underneath every user-generated JS program.

- In discussions under forums, videos, and articles on Khan Academy, external and internal links are hidden automatically, but will be approved by a moderator 
(our Guardians) if they are:

  - Helpful to the discussion at hand
  
  - Relevant
  
  - Appropriate
  
  - High-quality
  
  - Not advertising, promotional, or commercial

Examples of when linking to commercial sites may be permissible:

- An answer can best be supported and expanded by referring to a scientific article. The article is only available as an abstract without paying for it. If it is 
an article from a peer-reviewed science periodical, it's still fine to link to the abstract page.

- In the Help Center forums, linking to relevant external technical pages is generally fine if it helps solve a user issue using Khan Academy, even if they belong to a 
commercial company.

#### Images

Note: Not applicable for discussions under forums, videos, and articles on Khan Academy.

We currently allow user-generated images in the Support Community that are:

- Helpful to the discussion at hand

- Relevant

- Appropriate

- Do not contain personal information or commercial images

Please try to limit your image size to < 600 px width and height.

If you need to supply images that contain personal information, for instance about account issues or inappropriate user behavior, do so via the Report a problem 
button in the Help Center so the team can help you in a private channel.

#### Videos

Some technical issues are best explained using screen capture videos. If you need to do so, use the Report a problem button in the Help Center to ensure privacy. 

### Mission Removal Announcement

Email Announcement from Nov. 4, 2019

Khan Academy turned 10 years old this year! Since you’re a learner on Khan Academy, we wanted to let you know about some 2020 spring-cleaning upgrades to our platform, 
including changes to Missions. We launched Missions back in 2014. And, while many of us love Missions, it is written in an old code base that’s caused slower load times 
and bugs that just aren’t sustainable. This year we’re upgrading all of Khan Academy to new code that will allow us to deliver a far better experience for our users. As 
a result, Missions will no longer be available as of June 2020. We’re giving this advance notice to everyone who regularly uses Missions so you can begin to transition 
from Missions to Khan Academy’s newer mastery learning system, Course Mastery. Like Missions, Course Mastery allows you to set long-term goals to work toward at your 
own pace.

We took into account user feedback on Missions when developing Course Mastery:

- Some Missions users found it hard to understand why recommendations were being generated and how the system determined when you had mastered a topic. We’ve now 
simplified the algorithm and made it clear how to reach the next level.

- Users told us they wanted self-paced work beyond math, which Missions did not support. We now have Course Mastery in many courses including high school biology, AP 
Physics 1, AP US History, US government and civics, microeconomics, and numerous math courses.

And, we’re not done! We plan to implement more improvements and features in coming years. In the meantime we've compiled some frequently asked questions about the 
change below:

- How do I get started? You can get started by adding a course in your Learner home page.

- What happens to my Missions progress? Don’t worry, your Mission progress will not be lost! Any progress on skills made in Missions is automatically synced to Course 
Mastery! Additionally, any energy points and badges earned through Missions will also be retained.

- What happens to World of Math? Unfortunately, one thing we won’t be able to maintain is the World of Math mission. This was an extremely difficult decision but there 
is currently no equivalent mechanism in our mastery system. We may explore building out this feature in the future but there are no near-term plans to do so.

We have very mixed emotions. We’re sad to retire Missions—a product that’s been beloved by many—but we’re also excited and optimistic that our new code will allow us 
to more effectively meet your needs. If you have any questions, be sure to reach out to our support team.

Onward!

### Challenges/Contests

- Primavera (Spring)

- Khantober (October 1 - October 31)

- The Coding Olympics (Summer)

- Khan Academy Programming Olympics (

- Clash Of Code

- Khan Academy Olympics

- The KA Coding Cup (September 1 - October 12)

#### Judging Criteria

- Creativity - Does this program put an unexpected spin on the ordinary? Do they use shapes or ideas in cool ways?

- Complexity - Does this program appear to have taken lots of work? Is the code complex or output intricate?

- Quality Code - Does this program have cleanly indented, commented code? Are there any syntax errors or program logic errors?

- Interpretation - Does this program portray the overall theme of the contest?

#### When will the contests be released?

Contests will be released the first week of every other month, and will accept submissions for approximately 7 weeks.

#### How can I submit my entry for the contests?

Entries will need to be submitted as spin-offs of the contest announcement page (see the contests page), not this webpage.

#### Can I submit more than one entry?

Yes, you can submit more than one entry for the contest, but only one program per user can win. To enter another program, you will need to make another spin-off of the 
contest announcement page.

#### Can I use my alternate account to submit my entry?

Using alternate accounts is discouraged as it makes verifying originality very difficult. You can post your finished project to your alternate account but for the 
contest entry, use the account you do most of your work in.

#### Can I submit a program I have already made?

No. All entries need to be made after the contest is released. Using a program you have already created would give you an unfair advantage over the rest of the 
competition, and we want the contests to be fair!

#### Can I use code I have previously written?

You may use code blocks that you previously wrote in your entry as long as you clearly indicate with comments what code was previously written and where it came 
from. Please note that we will only judge code written after the start of the contest, so the previously written code should not be a significant part of your project.

#### Are collaborations allowed?

Yes, but only one member of the group will be awarded the Golden Winston (unless you make it on a shared account).

#### Can I use drawing tools?

Drawing tools are allowed, but they have to be used minimally, and you need to disclose in comments which parts were made with the tool. Your entire project shouldn't 
be made with a drawing tool.

#### When will entries be judged?

Entries will be judged following the end of the contest. We are a small team and have to work around many peoples' schedules, so we ask that you please be patient while 
we judge the entries. Results are normally posted 1-2 weeks after the deadline.

#### How are the entries sorted?

All entries will be sorted into 3 skill brackets ~ Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each skill bracket is judged separately, and winners are selected from each 
bracket. In order to ensure the system remains fair, we don't disclose the criteria for placing programs in the skill brackets.

#### Can I help judge entries?

Judging is not currently open to the public. All entries will be judged by the council members.

#### What will the winners receive?

For each contest, all winners will receive a Golden Winston badge specific to the contest.

#### How can I receive updates on the contests?

Updates on the contest will be posted on the home page of this webpage. You can also subscribe to the update thread below to receive notifications when new update posts 
are added.

### FAQ

#### How to hide your own program?

```
// /cs/pro/5733417664643072
```

That's it! When you click Save, you should have a scratchpad that will be hidden from the Hot list!

Important Information:

- This is not an actual feature, it's just a little trick that I'm testing. If for some reason it isn't working properly, feel free to let me know on this thread, but 
don't expect official support in general at this time as if it were an official feature.

- This is a one-way street. You won't be able to unhide your project if you choose to hide it this way, and Guardians will not unhide them either (please don't ask). I 
don't think this will be an issue, but it does need said.

- This only works (to my knowledge) when the scratchpad is first saved. You may want to save a project with just that in it to get it hidden so that you don't forget 
later. Adding the magic string after you've saved your project won't hide it!

- Feel free to use this for good legitimate uses, such as when you have a large work-in-progress that isn't really ready for exhibition to the community and voting, or 
those times when you want to make something relatively simple that you don't really want on the hot list. I haven't really thought of any way to misuse such a feature, 
but please don't misuse it if you do think of a way. (Instead, you might open a Help Center ticket and reference me and this discussion, in case the agent doesn't know 
what's going on.)

#### What are the Computer Programming Project guidelines?

#### About the "Hot" List

The "hot" list is a gallery of projects that have been recently popular with the community, according to votes. You can find that list by clicking "Browse projects" on 
the Computer Programming homepage.

The purpose of the "hot" list is to highlight original projects that create something really cool - like a game, graphic, or interactive simulation -- feel free to vote 
up a project if you’re impressed by its programming, functionality, or code!

#### Programs with Bookmarklets

All programs with bookmarklet code* should be Hidden from Everywhere. These circumvent some of the functionality that has been intentionally disabled, and thus poses a 
security risk.

*A bookmarklet is any code script that the program author asks the user to save as a browser bookmark. Clicking the bookmark with the saved code will then run the 
script, which has the potential to edit/delete the user’s site data or collect their personal information.

#### Using Disallowed Functionality

To ensure that the ProcessingJS programs you create on Khan Academy will continue working in the future, they should not use functionalities intentionally disabled for 
reasons of security, privacy, or user experience. Generally, that means that JS programs should not be accessing `externals` or the `DOM` in some way. Here are specific 
examples:

- LocalStorage: Programs should not attempt to get or set `localStorage`. Doing so will cause projects to run out of quota.

- Links: JS Programs should not automatically open links to other web pages, on Khan Academy or otherwise; if you want to direct learners to a relevant link please use 
`println()` with the URL instead.

- Sound: Programs should only create sounds using the `playSound/getSound` functions, with the sounds listed in the soundpicker. Programs should only play sounds in 
response to user interaction - i.e., inside one of the `mouse*` or `key*` event handling functions. Programs should not play sounds immediately upon load, and should 
not loop sounds endlessly.


#### What is the KACP Challenge Council?

The KACP Challenge Council is a group of users selected by KA staff to create monthly CS contests for the community. You can find more information about the council 
here: https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003790912

#### Why was my CS project hidden?

If a project or discussion post falls into one of the following disallowed criteria, a Guardian may hide it from the "hot" list and/or public view entirely. Learners 
who persistently break these rules may also get banned from community activity. Projects that spur discussions that distract from learning about computer programming 
and coding may also get hidden.

A project is considered inappropriate and will be hidden if it falls into one or more of the following categories:

- Offensive

  - Containing discriminatory or offensive language.

  - Sexual or violent content, or any other content that could reasonably be deemed inappropriate for an educational setting.
  
- Off-Topic

  - Advertisements or non-helpful links to 3rd party sites.

  - Controversial or divisive topics including religion, politics, or personal issues/revealing details that compromise learner privacy.

  - Social groups or clubs, or projects that generate social chats, and other posts not related to coding, in the discussion thread.

  - Asking others to “vote up” a project.
  
  - Garnering or receiving votes from a voting ring (groups of people who conspire to vote up each others’ projects). People who participate in voting rings will be 
  banned from community activity.

- Plagiarism

You can create spin-offs of projects by clicking the "Spin-off" button under each project. Creating a spin-off gives credit to the original creator and connects the new 
project to the original. Any learner can create a spin-off of any project.

It’s considered plagiarism if:

- A user pastes someone else's work into a new project, instead of creating a spin-off.

- A user pastes work from multiple projects without giving credit/links to those projects in comments at the top of the project.

#### What are the code reviewing guidelines?

Here are some common areas for improvement that you can comment on:

- Readability: How descriptive are their variable names? Is the indentation weird or non-existent? You can link them to the Readable Code talk-through to learn more.

- Comments: Could some complex parts of their code be commented better? You can link them to the Clarifying with Comments talk-through to learn more.

- Data Structures: Would their code be better if they used an object instead of an array? Keep in mind that not all learners will be familiar with all data structures, 
so you could say: "This would be a great place to use objects. If you haven't learned them yet, you could re-visit this once you have."

- Performance: Are they using draw, when they could actually just use mouseClicked or keyPressed?

And of course, do not be negative or offensive when offering your critique - be helpful and provide nice and actionable feedback!
