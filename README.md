# Khan Academy

### What is the history of Khan Academy?

Khan Academy is a not-for-profit educational organization started by Salman Khan in 2008. Our mission is to provide a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere.

Our online materials cover subjects ranging from math and finance to history and art. With thousands of bite-sized videos, step-by-step problems, and instant progress 
information, Khan Academy provides a rich and engaging learning experience. You can earn points and badges along the way, and coach others as well.

In addition to creating our online materials, we also translate our materials into the world's most spoken languages and work with schools on innovating how learning 
is done in the classroom.  Read more about Khan Academy's goals at http://www.khanacademy.org/about. 

### Who started Khan Academy?

Khan Academy was founded by Salman Khan. Sal was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. His mother was born in Calcutta, India; and his father was born in Barisal, 
Bangladesh. Sal is a former hedge fund analyst with degrees from MIT and Harvard. 

### How was Khan Academy started?

In August 2004, Sal Khan began remotely tutoring his cousin, Nadia, who was struggling with unit conversion. This "Swiss-cheese" gap in her knowledge was not allowing 
her to be placed in the more advanced math track. Since Nadia was in New Orleans, and Sal was in Boston working at a hedge fund at the time, Sal started tutoring her 
through the phone and Yahoo Doodle after work.

As Nadia improved in math class, word got around and Sal started tutoring a handful of his cousins and family members. Scheduling became a real issue, and he decided 
to begin recording videos and posting them on YouTube in 2006 so everyone could watch at their own pace. More and more people started watching, and Sal has been 
making videos ever since.

The organization was incorporated as a 501c(3) nonprofit in 2008. Sal continued to work on Khan Academy during his spare time until the fall of 2009, when he quit his 
hedge fund job and decided to pursue the endeavor full-time. He lived off of his savings for the first nine months, until he received his first significant donation 
from Ann Doerr. In September 2010, Khan Academy received large grants from Google ($2 million) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ($1.5 million) and began to 
build out an organization. 

Sal called on Shantanu Sinha from McKinsey & Company to join as President & COO. They were former high school math competitors in New Orleans, freshman year roommates 
at MIT, and long-time friends. They immediately hired Ben Kamens and Jason Rosoff from Fog Creek Software to lead software development and design. In October 2010, the 
small team moved into their first office space. 

### What makes Khan Academy a not-for-profit?

Khan Academy is an IRS-recognized 501(c)3 not-for-profit (nonprofit) organization. Khan Academy materials are available for free at www.khanacademy.org. The organization is supported through the generosity of donors and grants. We believe that everyone should have the right to access a world-class education for free.

Although Sal has been approached about making Khan Academy for-profit, it just didn't feel right to him. His view has been, “When I'm 80, I want to feel that I helped give access to a world-class education to billions of students around the world. Sounds a lot better than starting a business that educates some subset of the developed world that can pay $19.95/month and eventually sell it to some textbook company or something. I already have a beautiful wife, a hilarious son, two Hondas, and a decent house. What else does a man need?"

### How is Khan Academy effective and different from other resources?

Our Website
With thousands of videos, it is easily the most exhaustive collection of instruction on the Internet allowing learners to know that they can fill in almost any of their "gaps" with the content on this site. The content is made in digestible 5-20 minute chunks especially purposed for viewing on the computer as opposed to being a longer video of a conventional "physical" lecture. The conversational style of the videos is the tonal antithesis of what people traditionally associate with math and science instruction. The less obvious distinctions are, however, what makes the site hard to reproduce. 

Sal describes his teaching style as follows: “I teach the way that I wish I was taught. The lectures are coming from me, an actual human being who is fascinated by the world around him. The concepts are conveyed as they are understood by me, not as they are written in a textbook developed by an educational bureaucracy. Viewers know that it is the labor of love of one somewhat quirky and determined man who has a passion for learning and teaching. I don't think any corporate or governmental effort--regardless of how much money is thrown at the problem--can reproduce this."

"A lot of my own educational experience was spent frustrated with how information was conveyed in textbooks and lectures. There would be connections in the subject matter that standard curricula would ignore despite the fact that they make the content easier to understand, enjoy, and RETAIN. I felt like fascinating and INTUITIVE concepts were almost intentionally being butchered into pages and pages of sleep-inducing text and monotonic, scripted lectures. I saw otherwise intelligent peers memorizing steps and formulas for the next exam without any sense of the intuition or big picture, only to forget everything within a matter of weeks. These videos are my expression of how the concepts should have been expressed in the first place, all while not compromising rigor or comprehensiveness.”

#### Our Learning Model

Our model is applicable to any learner - it can be used as the core learning platform or a supplementary one. While many other models have created physical schools to enable their respective models, ours is a virtual classroom that facilitates existing physical schools to deepen the learning that happens within any classroom. It is also a model that can be extended to any learning environment with a device and an Internet connection - for group or individual learning, inside or outside the classroom.

Is It Effective?

Students have always liked Khan Academy.  The YouTube comments Sal Khan received when he posted his first videos in 2006 are what motivated him to keep going (and create thousands more).  However, it is still astonishing to see the impact our resources can have.  If Khan Academy changed just one student's life, it would have been worth creating Khan Academy.  The fact that this so easily scales to millions is what makes Khan Academy special.

Khan Academy seems to work well with supplemental learners, but how well does it work in schools?  We have always believed that a great teacher can take our resources and push learning to new heights, by better focusing on the individual needs of each student.   With the student mastering core skills on the computer, the teacher can leverage the classroom time for more engaging and dynamic activities such as project-based learning, peer tutoring, or lively discussion.

In the 2010-2011 school year, we started piloting our platform in a few schools in Los Altos, California.  Our goal was to create better tools by directly observing how teachers and students interacted with our product.   Los Altos was a fantastic partner, and our team built out many significant features based on their feedback (e.g., student knowledge map, teacher dashboards, badging infrastructure, new exercises).   

At the end of the school year, we all knew it was a success.  Teachers could see a dramatic change in their students’ excitement and enthusiasm towards math.  Students who traditionally struggled with the material were more confident and engaged.  Other students were challenging themselves to levels we never thought possible.  Common sense told everyone involved that we were on to something.   

We did not do a controlled research study.  In part, because our organization was only 5 people for most of the school year, and we were just trying to build something worth researching. Things changed fast for us, and the system the students were using at the end of the school year was very different from the system they started using in November.

However, we were curious to see how they did on traditional assessments like the end of year CST exam. It is not the ideal exam since it only tests performance on a narrow set of grade-level skills.  Many of our students were remediating topics they should have learned years ago, or challenging themselves with much more advanced topics.  None of these gains would be captured.  However, the CST clearly mattered, so it was worth understanding how our students performed.

The initial results were quite promising.  Our pilot included a couple of 7th-grade classrooms with students who typically struggled in Math. We saw a significant improvement in this group.  The number of Advanced or Proficient students increased dramatically, from 23% to 41%

This was very heartening.  Usually, the performance gap widens with students who struggle in Math, particularly when they get to more advanced topics like pre-algebra.  The fact that these students were closing the gap (non-pilot classrooms saw no significant change in their CST performance) was very promising. 

Our pilot also included a few 5th-grade classrooms.  Los Altos is a high performing district, and these students typically do very well on the CST.  This year was no different, with 96% of the students in pilot classrooms scoring Advanced or Proficient.   While these are great results, they are not statistically different from the non-pilot classrooms in the district.    It turns out, in both pilot and non-pilot classrooms, the students were doing great on the exam and didn’t have much room for improvement.

However, we could see amazing things happening with the 5th graders.  A majority of students were attempting early algebra, and many students were experimenting with trigonometry and calculus.  These students were excited, engaged, and loved being challenged.  Inadvertently, we highlighted a distinct but not often discussed problem with standardized, age-focused education.   Students performing at high levels are often not sufficiently challenged.  Teachers shouldn’t take kids who already know the material, and make sure they already know the material.  Teachers should be pushing and challenging the students to their full abilities.  Los Altos didn’t think everything was perfect because their students were scoring well on standardized exams; they saw significant value in creating an environment that was engaging and challenging for all students.

Based on these experiences, Los Altos decided to expand the implementation district-wide for the 2011-2012 school year to over 40 more classrooms, and we decided to expand and work with a number of additional schools that represent different use cases (e.g., charter, independent, low-income, special needs) to understand how students react to our resources in these different settings, as well as try out better evaluation methodology that reflects learning gains across multiple grade levels.

We are absolutely convinced that our resources can have a huge impact on the learning process. But why exactly does Khan Academy work? Some people have a hard time understanding how online videos and practice exercises can make such a big difference.

Putting videos on YouTube is just a small piece of the equation. What Khan Academy enables is a fundamentally different way for students to approach learning. Here’s my take on the many innovations we are bundling together into a coherent experience. This is what is really making the difference.

- Students are free to learn anytime, anywhere

- Students can jump to where help is needed most, and spend as much time as necessary to master concepts 

- The content is short, fun, approachable, and easily digestible

- There is a clear and continuous path to learning complex topics

- Students feel an increased sense of ownership - they are learning, not “being taught”

- The focus on core conceptual understanding ensures students build the necessary skills that are applicable in any curriculum used in schools

- Interactive practice ensures concepts truly sink in

- Rich analytics help teachers monitor progress and provide focused support

- Teachers are empowered to make their classroom experiences much more fun, engaging, and social, with less lecturing and more project-based learning and peer tutoring

The results so far have been promising. However, in our view, we’re just getting started. We still have a long way to go to reach our vision for technology-enabled education. For the full blog post, check out www.khanacademy.org/about/blog/post/10243685407/impact-from-using-khan-academy

### Why isn't my Khan Academy account automatically linked to the Support Community?

If your Khan Academy account isn't automatically allowing you to participate in our Support Community, it's usually because we don't have a verified email address associated with your current Khan Academy account. Our community software (Zendesk) uses email addresses to link your Khan Academy account to your posts in the Support Community, so once you add an email to your Khan Academy account and verify it, you should be good to go.

You can add an email address to your account in your Settings, under Linked Accounts. If you have added an email but it hasn't been verified yet, there will be a blue banner at the top of your account asking to verify it click the "Resend email" link to start verifying.

There are some exceptions:

- If a learner is under 13, they have a child account and are restricted from leaving public comments in the Support Community to protect their privacy. More information on the differences between child and adult accounts can be found here. Anyone can reach our support team privately for help by filing a new ticket describing their situation.

- If you have been banned from discussions on Khan Academy, you cannot participate in conversations in the Support Community. If you feel like you have been banned in error, please use this form to describe your situation.

### What are Khan Academy's Content Principles?

Khan Academy’s mission is to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere.

Our Content Principles support and guide our Content Team in delivering on that mission.

#### Content Principles

- Learners at the center:  We strive to create deeply engaging,  rigorous educational  content that is welcoming to learners,  ignites their curiosity,  and accelerates their learning.

- Accuracy: In service to creating world-class educational materials, we prioritize accuracy in all of our content. To achieve this, we staff our team with subject matter experts who use a wide range of source materials as inputs. In addition, we put our content through rigorous reviews and monitor feedback regularly.

- Diversity and Inclusion: We believe that learners are more likely to engage and learn when they feel a sense of belonging in what they’re learning. We also believe they will be better citizens of the world if they are exposed to the lives of others. Because of this, we are committed to representing the diversity of the world and our learner community in the content we offer.  

- Appropriate Context: Some topics are potentially uncomfortable for learners (for example,  historical injustices such as slavery) but they are also a part of the human experience and an important component of a world-class education. We include these topics in our content when they are relevant to the subject matter and with supporting context to promote deep understanding and constructive discussion.

- Editorial integrity: Khan Academy maintains full editorial control of Khan Academy-owned content. Some content on Khan Academy is sponsored by or made in partnership with other groups, but our editorial independence remains consistent in all cases. Please view our content sponsorship principles for more information. 


### What are energy points, badges, and avatars?

#### Energy Points

Energy points measure effort on Khan Academy. Learners earn more energy points by pushing the edge of their knowledge. They are not a measure of mastery or ability.

As of 9/22/2017, you get points for the following learning tasks:

- Completing Computer Programming challenges

- Video completed

- Videos already watched

- Practice problems

- Completing tasks

#### Badges

Badges are awarded for behaviors— earning points, achieving mastery of exercises, or other behaviors like building community or learning computer science.

There are five primary levels of badges. From the most common to the rarest, they are:

- Meteorite

- Moon

- Earth

- Sun

- Black Hole

There are also other special "Challenge Patches," which can be earned for completing certain course units, tutorials, or special activities.

#### Avatars

Your avatar is a character that represents you in the Khan Academy Community. Some avatars are available for you to choose from as soon as you join Khan Academy; others become available as you earn energy points or work on specific activities.

Many avatars have evolutions— as you earn more energy points, more advanced versions of the avatar become available for you to choose from.

You can change your avatar by clicking on the image next to your name on your profile page.

### What are Khan Academy's Community Guidelines?

The mission of Khan Academy is to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere, and the goal of these Community Guidelines is to provide a welcoming 
environment where everyone feels comfortable learning.  

#### Give a great answer

- We're teaching each other – so, instead of responding with "Yes" or "No", share your answer the way your favorite teacher would! Give complete answers that are 
easy to understand.

- Remember that you were once new here, too! Be patient and take the time to make people feel welcome and help them get started on their learning journey. Share your 
own tips and tricks for using Khan Academy.

- When relevant, it can be helpful share links to additional resources that people might find useful (such as articles in our Help Center).

#### Be self-sufficient

- Before asking a question, do a quick check to see if it’s been asked before. If it has, add your comment in the existing thread, or vote someone else’s comment 
up. You can also find great resources in our Help Center and Support Community.

- If someone has already answered a question, don't repeat their answer – upvote it instead.

Here's what to avoid:

- Low-quality comments

  - These include duplicate answers, nonsense, spam or repetitive posts, advertisements, low-quality links, asking others to follow you or upvote your posts, and 
  anything containing offensive language.

  - Anything rude or disrespectful to another Khan Academy member, including volunteers and staff. This includes impersonating someone else.

  - In general, if you’re not comfortable with a parent or teacher reading what you’re writing, it’s best not to post it.  Remember that Khan Academy is used by 
  learners of all ages, and we expect everyone’s comments to reflect that.

- Off-topic discussions

  - Keep the conversations relevant to the subject that you’re posting in. Questions and comments not related to khanacademy.org subject content should be posted in 
  the appropriate subforum in the Support Community.  This includes Computer Programming projects - comments and discussions should stay focused on the code itself.

  - Since Khan Academy is focused on learning above all else, we ask that discussion about religion and current political events generally be kept off the site.  There 
  are many places on the internet where these discussions are very welcome, but we’ve found these topics to be largely distracting on Khan Academy.  
  
    - Note: exceptions can be made for certain pieces of humanities content (such as history), but please take a minute before posting to make sure that any comments 
    you make are truly in the best interest of the community.

  - Don’t solicit personal information from others (this includes real names, email addresses, ages, locations, and anything else that someone might want to keep 
  private), or post personal information that isn’t appropriate to share publicly.
  
Violations of these Guidelines may result in post removal, suspension of commenting privileges, and other administrative actions.

### Why was I banned?

In general, users who persistently violate Khan Academy's Community Guidelines may be banned from community activities by a Guardian. If you'd like specific 
information about why your account was banned, or if you'd like to submit a ban appeal, please fill out and submit a Ban Appeal Form.

A Guardian will review your request and respond to you via a Guardian message on your profile. Please note that we receive lots of ban appeal requests, so it may 
take several days to receive a response.

### How do I contact Khan Academy?

For help using the Khan Academy website and mobile app, please check out our Help Center and our Support Community.
 
You can also report a problem with any part of the Khan Academy website or mobile app here.
 
For donation related inquiries please email donate@khanacademy.org.

#### Why can't I vote on a comment?

You won't be able to up- or down-vote comments until you've earned 5,000 energy points from learning on Khan Academy.

### What are the guidelines for posting links, images, and videos on the community forums?

These are guidelines for posting links, images, and videos in our discussion forums and Support Community. For guidelines on user-created programs, consult the 
Guidelines tab under the program.

#### Links

- For the use of links on user-generated JS programs, see the JS Guidelines. These can be found underneath every user-generated JS program.

- In discussions under forums, videos, and articles on Khan Academy, external and internal links are hidden automatically, but will be approved by a moderator 
(our Guardians) if they are:

  - Helpful to the discussion at hand
  
  - Relevant
  
  - Appropriate
  
  - High-quality
  
  - Not advertising, promotional, or commercial

Examples of when linking to commercial sites may be permissible:

- An answer can best be supported and expanded by referring to a scientific article. The article is only available as an abstract without paying for it. If it is 
an article from a peer-reviewed science periodical, it's still fine to link to the abstract page.

- In the Help Center forums, linking to relevant external technical pages is generally fine if it helps solve a user issue using Khan Academy, even if they belong to a 
commercial company.

#### Images

Note: Not applicable for discussions under forums, videos, and articles on Khan Academy.

We currently allow user-generated images in the Support Community that are:

- Helpful to the discussion at hand

- Relevant

- Appropriate

- Do not contain personal information or commercial images

Please try to limit your image size to < 600 px width and height.

If you need to supply images that contain personal information, for instance about account issues or inappropriate user behavior, do so via the Report a problem 
button in the Help Center so the team can help you in a private channel.

#### Videos

Some technical issues are best explained using screen capture videos. If you need to do so, use the Report a problem button in the Help Center to ensure privacy. 

### How can I become a Guardian and what does this entail?

The following are requirements for Guardians, and Senior Guardians (site moderators): 

Guardians

- Demonstrated contributions to the Khan Academy community in the form of answering questions, contributing to discussions, and high-quality comments. This ensures that incoming Guardians are familiar with the Khan Academy platform and community, and have experience contributing great answers and feedback.

- At least 16 years of age. The role of Guardian is an important one within the community, and we take their contributions and actions very seriously. Because helping keep the community active and safe requires a certain level of maturity and judgment, we do require a minimum age of sixteen.

- A record free of any bans or repeated bad behavior, such as plagiarism, vote soliciting or spamming for at least 12 months. Khan Academy Guardians are role models to the community, and as role models, they should have a record clear of any recent bad behavior. People make mistakes, but good learners grow and learn from their mistakes. This shouldn’t discourage community members who have received messages from Guardians in the past for different behavior; what matters is that the guidance was heeded and better behavior followed.

- Ideologically neutral username and bio that is absent of any overt political, religious, or otherwise controversial affiliation. The role of a Guardian is focused on community moderation and enhancing the educational experience, and the presence of political, religious, or otherwise controversial profiles can be distracting to the content and situations at hand.

- Demonstrated ability to handle potential conflicts between community members in a diplomatic, nurturing, and firm manner. As with any online community, there can be situations where community members are in conflict with each other or in need of real help (for safety reasons or otherwise). Guardians are one of the first lines of help in these situations, so the ability to evaluate and handle difficult situations in a mature and supportive way is a key component of Guardianship.

Senior Guardians (currently inactive)

This is a senior volunteer role for existing Guardians who have exemplified leadership and wish to take an expanded role in supporting the community.

- A strong record of excellent judgement in moderating the Khan Academy community as a Guardian for at least 6 months. Senior Guardians need to have demonstrated leadership and excellent judgment in their time as a Guardian.

- At least 18 years of age. The role of Senior Guardian is a stronger leadership role within the community, and we take their contributions and actions very seriously. Because helping keep the community active and safe requires a certain level of maturity and judgment, we do require a minimum age of eighteen.

- Ability to pass a background check. Senior Moderator Guardians have access to additional tools that require a higher level of trust.

- A record free of any banning or repeated bad behavior, such as plagiarism, vote soliciting or spamming for at least 24 months. Our Guardians are role models to the community, and as role models, they should have a record clear of any recent bad behavior for a significant amount of time.

Guardians are expected to:

- Regularly review, take action on, and empty the flagged content queue (at least 20 posts per month).

- Edit content when necessary. If a post is useful but in all caps or has spelling mistakes or a dozen question marks, we correct it. If it is useful but asking for votes, we remove the part that asks for votes. You can also reword questions to make them better.

- Generally, keep an eye out for and take action on negative behavioral trends.

- Message users who have been participating in a discussion but have made off-topic posts, such as chit-chat, repeated vote/badge seeking, or homework questions.

- Maintain communications with fellow Guardians and Khan Academy staff and respond to their inquiries, where relevant.

- Ban users in extreme cases.

Application Process

Apply via the Khan Academy Guardian Application so we can follow up with you about your interest in helping the Khan Academy community.

### Mission Removal Announcement

Email Announcement from Nov. 4, 2019

Khan Academy turned 10 years old this year! Since you’re a learner on Khan Academy, we wanted to let you know about some 2020 spring-cleaning upgrades to our platform, 
including changes to Missions. We launched Missions back in 2014. And, while many of us love Missions, it is written in an old code base that’s caused slower load times 
and bugs that just aren’t sustainable. This year we’re upgrading all of Khan Academy to new code that will allow us to deliver a far better experience for our users. As 
a result, Missions will no longer be available as of June 2020. We’re giving this advance notice to everyone who regularly uses Missions so you can begin to transition 
from Missions to Khan Academy’s newer mastery learning system, Course Mastery. Like Missions, Course Mastery allows you to set long-term goals to work toward at your 
own pace.

We took into account user feedback on Missions when developing Course Mastery:

- Some Missions users found it hard to understand why recommendations were being generated and how the system determined when you had mastered a topic. We’ve now 
simplified the algorithm and made it clear how to reach the next level.

- Users told us they wanted self-paced work beyond math, which Missions did not support. We now have Course Mastery in many courses including high school biology, AP 
Physics 1, AP US History, US government and civics, microeconomics, and numerous math courses.

And, we’re not done! We plan to implement more improvements and features in coming years. In the meantime we've compiled some frequently asked questions about the 
change below:

- How do I get started? You can get started by adding a course in your Learner home page.

- What happens to my Missions progress? Don’t worry, your Mission progress will not be lost! Any progress on skills made in Missions is automatically synced to Course 
Mastery! Additionally, any energy points and badges earned through Missions will also be retained.

- What happens to World of Math? Unfortunately, one thing we won’t be able to maintain is the World of Math mission. This was an extremely difficult decision but there 
is currently no equivalent mechanism in our mastery system. We may explore building out this feature in the future but there are no near-term plans to do so.

We have very mixed emotions. We’re sad to retire Missions—a product that’s been beloved by many—but we’re also excited and optimistic that our new code will allow us 
to more effectively meet your needs. If you have any questions, be sure to reach out to our support team.

Onward!

The Khan Academy Team

### Challenges/Contests

- Khantober (October 1 - October 31)

- The Coding Olympics (Summer)

- Khan Academy Programming Olympics 

- Clash Of Code

- Khan Academy Olympics

- The KA Coding Cup (September 1 - October 12)

#### Judging Criteria

- Creativity - Does this program put an unexpected spin on the ordinary? Do they use shapes or ideas in cool ways?

- Complexity - Does this program appear to have taken lots of work? Is the code complex or output intricate?

- Quality Code - Does this program have cleanly indented, commented code? Are there any syntax errors or program logic errors?

- Interpretation - Does this program portray the overall theme of the contest?

#### When will the contests be released?

Contests will be released the first week of every other month, and will accept submissions for approximately 7 weeks.

#### How can I submit my entry for the contests?

Entries will need to be submitted as spin-offs of the contest announcement page (see the contests page), not this webpage.

#### Can I submit more than one entry?

Yes, you can submit more than one entry for the contest, but only one program per user can win. To enter another program, you will need to make another spin-off of the 
contest announcement page.

#### Can I use my alternate account to submit my entry?

Using alternate accounts is discouraged as it makes verifying originality very difficult. You can post your finished project to your alternate account but for the 
contest entry, use the account you do most of your work in.

#### Can I submit a program I have already made?

No. All entries need to be made after the contest is released. Using a program you have already created would give you an unfair advantage over the rest of the 
competition, and we want the contests to be fair!

#### Can I use code I have previously written?

You may use code blocks that you previously wrote in your entry as long as you clearly indicate with comments what code was previously written and where it came 
from. Please note that we will only judge code written after the start of the contest, so the previously written code should not be a significant part of your project.

#### Are collaborations allowed?

Yes, but only one member of the group will be awarded the Golden Winston (unless you make it on a shared account).

#### Can I use drawing tools?

Drawing tools are allowed, but they have to be used minimally, and you need to disclose in comments which parts were made with the tool. Your entire project shouldn't 
be made with a drawing tool.

#### When will entries be judged?

Entries will be judged following the end of the contest. We are a small team and have to work around many peoples' schedules, so we ask that you please be patient while 
we judge the entries. Results are normally posted 1-2 weeks after the deadline.

#### How are the entries sorted?

All entries will be sorted into 3 skill brackets ~ Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each skill bracket is judged separately, and winners are selected from each 
bracket. In order to ensure the system remains fair, we don't disclose the criteria for placing programs in the skill brackets.

#### Can I help judge entries?

Judging is not currently open to the public. All entries will be judged by the council members.

#### What will the winners receive?

For each contest, all winners will receive a Golden Winston badge specific to the contest.

#### How can I receive updates on the contests?

Updates on the contest will be posted on the home page of this webpage. You can also subscribe to the update thread below to receive notifications when new update posts 
are added.

#### Black Hole Badges:

Black Hole badges are legendary and unknown. They are the rarest Khan Academy awards.

The Black Hole badges on Khan Academy are legendary and unknown, so a lot of people want to know how to get them. There was a time when the code describing how the badges could be gained was online. At the time the Atlas badge was awarded for completing 150 exercises. But at that time there were fewer than 100 exercises on Khan Academy.

Of all the black hole badges, the most attainable is Tesla. This badge is awarded for getting 10 million energy points. Several people have got it now, some using various cheat to generate points. But there are enough videos and exercises that you can get this badge without cheating. This video show when I got the Tesla badge:

The Atlas badge is the most changeable of badges, always moving out of reach (except for the one time Ben Eater, lead exercise developer on Khan Academy got it by mistake). It was once for completing 150 exercises, then 250 and then 500. Now it has changed again, to another unattainable number. I suspect that when Khan Academy feels there are enough exercises to cover all of high school maths (or maybe one topic), then they will settle on a number. But for now it is not possible.

That leaves the latest badge, Artemis. I did look up the code for this badge when I was employed by Khan Academy and had access to their code. All I can say is that, like Atlas, it is currently not possible to get this badge.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### How to hide your own program?

```
// /cs/pro/5733417664643072
```

That's it! When you click Save, you should have a scratchpad that will be hidden from the Hot list!

Important Information:

- This is not an actual feature, it's just a little trick that I'm testing. If for some reason it isn't working properly, feel free to let me know on this thread, but 
don't expect official support in general at this time as if it were an official feature.

- This is a one-way street. You won't be able to unhide your project if you choose to hide it this way, and Guardians will not unhide them either (please don't ask). I 
don't think this will be an issue, but it does need said.

- This only works (to my knowledge) when the scratchpad is first saved. You may want to save a project with just that in it to get it hidden so that you don't forget 
later. Adding the magic string after you've saved your project won't hide it!

- Feel free to use this for good legitimate uses, such as when you have a large work-in-progress that isn't really ready for exhibition to the community and voting, or 
those times when you want to make something relatively simple that you don't really want on the hot list. I haven't really thought of any way to misuse such a feature, 
but please don't misuse it if you do think of a way. (Instead, you might open a Help Center ticket and reference me and this discussion, in case the agent doesn't know 
what's going on.)

#### What are the Computer Programming Project guidelines?

#### About the "Hot" List

The "hot" list is a gallery of projects that have been recently popular with the community, according to votes. You can find that list by clicking "Browse projects" on 
the Computer Programming homepage.

The purpose of the "hot" list is to highlight original projects that create something really cool - like a game, graphic, or interactive simulation -- feel free to vote 
up a project if you’re impressed by its programming, functionality, or code!

#### Programs with Bookmarklets

All programs with bookmarklet code* should be Hidden from Everywhere. These circumvent some of the functionality that has been intentionally disabled, and thus poses a 
security risk.

*A bookmarklet is any code script that the program author asks the user to save as a browser bookmark. Clicking the bookmark with the saved code will then run the 
script, which has the potential to edit/delete the user’s site data or collect their personal information.

#### Using Disallowed Functionality

To ensure that the ProcessingJS programs you create on Khan Academy will continue working in the future, they should not use functionalities intentionally disabled for 
reasons of security, privacy, or user experience. Generally, that means that JS programs should not be accessing `externals` or the `DOM` in some way. Here are specific 
examples:

- Local Storage: Programs should not attempt to get or set `localStorage`. Doing so will cause projects to run out of quota.

- Links: JS Programs should not automatically open links to other web pages, on Khan Academy or otherwise; if you want to direct learners to a relevant link please use 
`println()` with the URL instead.

- Sound: Programs should only create sounds using the `playSound/getSound` functions, with the sounds listed in the soundpicker. Programs should only play sounds in 
response to user interaction - i.e., inside one of the `mouse*` or `key*` event handling functions. Programs should not play sounds immediately upon load, and should 
not loop sounds endlessly.

#### What is the KACP Challenge Council?

The KACP Challenge Council is a group of users selected by KA staff to create monthly CS contests for the community. You can find more information about the council 
here: https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003790912

#### Why was my CS project hidden?

If a project or discussion post falls into one of the following disallowed criteria, a Guardian may hide it from the "hot" list and/or public view entirely. Learners 
who persistently break these rules may also get banned from community activity. Projects that spur discussions that distract from learning about computer programming 
and coding may also get hidden.

A project is considered inappropriate and will be hidden if it falls into one or more of the following categories:

- Offensive

  - Containing discriminatory or offensive language.

  - Sexual or violent content, or any other content that could reasonably be deemed inappropriate for an educational setting.
  
- Off-Topic

  - Advertisements or non-helpful links to 3rd party sites.

  - Controversial or divisive topics including religion, politics, or personal issues/revealing details that compromise learner privacy.

  - Social groups or clubs, or projects that generate social chats, and other posts not related to coding, in the discussion thread.

  - Asking others to “vote up” a project.
  
  - Garnering or receiving votes from a voting ring (groups of people who conspire to vote up each others’ projects). People who participate in voting rings will be 
  banned from community activity.

- Plagiarism

You can create spin-offs of projects by clicking the "Spin-off" button under each project. Creating a spin-off gives credit to the original creator and connects the new 
project to the original. Any learner can create a spin-off of any project.

It’s considered plagiarism if:

- A user pastes someone else's work into a new project, instead of creating a spin-off.

- A user pastes work from multiple projects without giving credit/links to those projects in comments at the top of the project.

#### What are the code reviewing guidelines?

Here are some common areas for improvement that you can comment on:

- Readability: How descriptive are their variable names? Is the indentation weird or non-existent? You can link them to the Readable Code talk-through to learn more.

- Comments: Could some complex parts of their code be commented better? You can link them to the Clarifying with Comments talk-through to learn more.

- Data Structures: Would their code be better if they used an object instead of an array? Keep in mind that not all learners will be familiar with all data structures, 
so you could say: "This would be a great place to use objects. If you haven't learned them yet, you could re-visit this once you have."

- Performance: Are they using draw, when they could actually just use mouseClicked or keyPressed?

And of course, do not be negative or offensive when offering your critique - be helpful and provide nice and actionable feedback!
